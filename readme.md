# üéôÔ∏è Background Speech Recognition with Python

This Python script listens to the microphone in the background and transcribes spoken words into text using Google Speech Recognition.

---

## üìñ Overview

This project uses the `speech_recognition` library to:
- Continuously listen to audio from the microphone.
- Transcribe speech in real-time using Google's Web Speech API.
- Handle recognition asynchronously while other tasks run in the main thread.
